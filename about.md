I’m Kemeriya Abdulkerim, a data science enthusiast passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights and intelligent solutions. My journey began with a deep dive into computer science and algorithmic problem-solving, and it evolved into a focus on data analysis, machine learning, and AI-driven decision-making.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from fraud detection in financial systems to IoT-based optimization, and I continue to explore how data can power smarter, more ethical technology. Currently, I’m building my expertise in data engineering and advanced analytics while managing a digital marketing agency in Ethiopia — where I apply data-driven strategies to real-world business challenges.

I’m driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the goal of creating solutions that connect data, technology, and human impact.

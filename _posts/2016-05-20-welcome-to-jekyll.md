## 💼 Professional Background

I am a Data Science Master’s student with hands-on experience in both research and product management. My professional journey began as a **Product Manager at A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley)**, where I led the development of **Dime**, a remittance application. I coordinated a team of five engineers, applying Agile methodologies to meet project deadlines while ensuring high-quality product delivery. Key accomplishments include improving test coverage from 40% to 65% and boosting Zemen Bank’s mobile app adoption by 1.8×, while reducing in-branch transactions.

I also gained research experience as a **Research Intern at IMT Nord Europe**, developing methods to extract partial human pose descriptions from plantar pressure data using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and real-world AI applications, combining software, hardware, and human-centered insights.  

**Key Achievements & Skills:**  
- Led cross-functional teams in Agile sprints  
- Applied data-driven strategies to product improvements  
- Experience with sensor-based AI research  
- Strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills

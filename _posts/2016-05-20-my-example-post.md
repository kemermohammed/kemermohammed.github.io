## 🕒 Daily Life

A typical day as a Data Science Master’s student in Lille is a mix of lectures, coding projects, research, and personal exploration. Mornings often start with courses in machine learning, statistics, or databases. Afternoons are dedicated to hands-on projects, data analysis, and collaborative work with classmates. Evenings are reserved for reviewing coursework, preparing assignments, or exploring new research opportunities.  

Balancing academics with city exploration, tech meetups, and culinary experiences has taught me discipline, time management, and adaptability. Each day is an opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with both technology and the wider community.

## 🌟 Interests & Passions

Beyond professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about technology, creativity, and cultural exploration. I enjoy experimenting with AI projects, analyzing real-world datasets, and sharing insights with peers. My interests include understanding human behavior, applying data science to meaningful problems, and exploring new tools and techniques in machine learning and software development.  

I also enjoy creative endeavors, cultural studies, and literature, which broaden my perspective and inspire innovative solutions. Exploring diverse interests allows me to approach problems holistically and maintain a balance between technical rigor and creative thinking.

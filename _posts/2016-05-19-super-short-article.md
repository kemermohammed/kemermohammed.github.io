## ✈️ Travel & Exploration

Traveling has been an essential part of my life, allowing me to experience diverse cultures, cuisines, and environments. I have visited multiple countries, including **China**, **Netherlands**, **Argentina**, **Brazil**, **France**, and **Ethiopia**. Each destination provided unique insights into local customs, architecture, and social dynamics.  

I am passionate about food and enjoy tasting regional specialties, with a particular love for **croissants, pastries, and local delicacies**. Travel has expanded my worldview, inspired creativity, and reinforced my adaptability and appreciation for cultural diversity.

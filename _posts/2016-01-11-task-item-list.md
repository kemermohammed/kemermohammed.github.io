## 🎮 Hobbies & Lifestyle

Outside academics and work, I enjoy activities that combine mental engagement with relaxation. I play chess and card games, watch Netflix movies and series, and spend quality time engaging with children in playful and educational activities.  

Fun facts:  
- I dislike video games but enjoy interactive and social games  
- I am a foodie, always eager to try new flavors and dishes  
- Balancing hobbies with studies and professional work keeps me energized and creative  

These pursuits contribute to a balanced lifestyle, cultivating curiosity, critical thinking, and personal growth alongside professional and academic development.
